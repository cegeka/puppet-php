Introduction
============

``puppet-php`` is a module for managing PHP using puppet.

Documentation
-------------

The module aims to use sane defaults and be easily configurable with hiera.

The recommended way is to use the main class to install php with following defaults.

```puppet
class { '::php':
  manage_repos => true,
  fpm          => true,
  apache       => false,
  dev          => true,
  composer     => true,
  pear         => true,
  extensions   => {}
}
```

### Installing extensions

Extensions can be installed either by using the parameter on the main class or by defining the hash `php::extension` in hiera.

```puppet
php::extensions:
  json: {}
  mysql: {}
  pecl-memcached:
    provider: pecl
    header_packages:
      - libmemcached-dev
```
